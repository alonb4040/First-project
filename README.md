# First-project
News engine search. Sending customized articles details to e-mail.
You can get articles based on the keywords that interest you. The engine will search the entire bank of articles for only those whose titles are relevant to the keywords. You can search by a full match or a partial match and even search for a specipic date.


*Note - the script is insensitive (doesn't matter if you use big\small letters.


Partial match - searching for articles and sending all the articles that their title contains the sequence of the keyword. 
For example: for the keyword 'cov' the engine returns articles which in their title there is the sequence 'cov' such as: 'covid', 'covid-19' 
but for the keywod 'alon' the engine can return articles with the word 'alone' in their title. For these scenarios there is the full match option, so the engine will return articles with with the exact sequence only 


You can choose articles from a specipic date or from anytime.


ENJOY:)
