News engine search. Sending to e-mail customized articles details in a convenient and accessible way.
You can get articles based on the keywords that interest you. The engine will search the entire bank of articles for only those whose titles are relevant to the keywords. You can search by full match or partial match.
*note - the script is insensitive (doesn't matter if you use big\small letters.
Example of partial match. For the keyword 'cov' the engine returns articles which in their titles there are word/s that contain the sequence 'cov' such as: 'covid', 'covid-19'
* Note, sometimes by using full match choice only, you will get unwanted results for example. for the keyword 'Alon' you will get also results if the title contains the word 'alone' and for that you have the full match chioce only. 
You can choose articles from a specipic date or from anytime.
good luch:)
